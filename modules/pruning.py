def reduced_error_pruning(root,training_set,validation_set):
    '''
    take the a node, training set, and validation set and returns the improved node.
    You can implement this as you choose, but the goal is to remove some nodes such that doing so improves validation accuracy.
    NOTE you will probably not need to use the training set for your pruning strategy, but it's passed as an argument in the starter code just in case.
